## Discussion Questions

1. How is Breadth-first Search different in graphs than in trees? Describe the differences in your own words.

Breath-first search is different in trees and graphs in that for graphs it's a little more comiplated due to the possiblity of running back into a node we're already seen, something that doesn't happen in trees.

2. What is one application of Breadth-first Search (besides social networks)? Describe how BFS is used for that application. If you need some ideas, check out [this article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/applications-of-breadth-first-traversal/?ref=rp).

GPS's can use Breath-first search to find the shortest distance from the users location to where they want to go.
